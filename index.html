        <h2>Landscape Photography</h2>
        <p>Landscape photography shows spaces within the world, sometimes vast and unending, but other times
          microscopic. Landscape photographs typically capture the presence of nature but can also focus on man-made
          features or disturbances of landscapes. Landscape photography is done for a variety of reasons. <br><br> Perhaps the
          most common is to recall a personal observation or experience while in the outdoors, especially when
          traveling. Others pursue it particularly as an outdoor lifestyle, to be involved with nature and the
          elements, some as an escape from the artificial world.</p>
